# Todo App

## Introuduction
This is an introductory project aimed to get familiar on using djangorestframework with reactjs  
Here we have used django rest framework to build a restful api, which serves data to react app  
Basic CRUD operations are implemented on Task  
Responsive Ui is built using Reactjs

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repo
2. install required dependencies
3. cd into the directory and run python manage.py runserver to run api
4. cd into todo_react directory and run npm start to run developer server

## Footnote
As mentioned before this is a learning project and main focus is to learn about django rest framework and api integration in react  
Hence ui is very basic and improvements to the same are welcome
